# message = 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

print (message)

# 7. Eggs is a valid variable name because it's 
#   not using a reserved keyword and 100 is invalid because 
#   it's an integer.

# 8. int(value), float(value) and str(value) get the integer,
#   floating-point or string version of a value, respectively.
